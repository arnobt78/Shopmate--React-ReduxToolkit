## 🛒 Project Summary

**Shopmate** is a fully functional demo E-Commerce web application built with React, Redux, and Redux Toolkit. The app demonstrates how to manage global state in a modern React application using Redux and Redux Toolkit, rather than `useContext` or `useReducer`. Shopmate features a responsive UI, dynamic routing, product listing, cart management, and stateful interactions, making it a great learning project for intermediate to advanced React developers.

    git clone https://github.com/arnobt78/Shopmate--React-ReduxToolkit.git
    cd Shopmate--React-ReduxToolkit
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install Node.js if you don't have it:**
    - Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)

4. **(Optional) Install React Router:**
    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```
    See more at [React Router Docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

5. **(Optional) Install Redux and Redux Toolkit:**

### Scripts

Available NPM scripts in this project:

- `npm start` — Run the app in development mode ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))
- `npm test` — Launch the test runner in watch mode
- `npm run build` — Build the app for production in the `build` folder
- `npm run eject` — Ejects the app (not reversible!)

## 🧠 Redux Toolkit Overview

- **Redux**: A pattern and library for managing and updating application state using "actions".
- **Slice**: A collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a feature, typically defined together in a slice file.
- **Action**: A plain JS object with a `type` field, describing something that happened in the app.
- **Reducer**: Specifies how state changes in response to actions.
- **Store**: Holds the application state and provides methods for dispatching actions.
- **useSelector**: Extract data from the Redux store state.
- **useDispatch**: Dispatch actions to the Redux store.
- **Provider**: Makes the Redux store available to nested components.

**Workflow:**
1. Create a slice: define name, initialState, and reducers.
2. Export actions and reducers.
3. Register reducers in `store.js`.
4. Wrap `<App />` with `<Provider store={store}>`.
5. Use `useDispatch` to send actions and `useSelector` to access state.

## 🔍 Core Functionalities & Walkthrough

### App Flow

- **Home Page:** Lists available products using data from Redux store.
- **Product Details:** Displays details when a product is selected.
- **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to the cart using Redux actions.
- **Cart Page:** Shows items added to the cart, allows item removal or quantity adjustment.
- **Routing:** Managed with React Router (`src/routes`) for multiple pages.
- **Global State:** Cart and product data managed globally with Redux Toolkit slices.
- **UI Components:** Modular components for product cards, cart items, navigation, etc.

### Redux Example

```js
// src/store/cartSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    addToCart: (state, action) => { /* ... */ },
    removeFromCart: (state, action) => { /* ... */ },
  },
});

export const { addToCart, removeFromCart } = cartSlice.actions;
export default cartSlice.reducer;
```
In your component:
```js
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addToCart } from '../store/cartSlice';

const products = useSelector((state) => state.products);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

const handleAdd = (product) => {
  dispatch(addToCart(product));
};
```

---

## 🧩 Examples

#### Example: Adding a Product to Cart

```js
// In a ProductCard component
<button onClick={() => dispatch(addToCart(product))}>
  Add to Cart
</button>
```

#### Example: Selecting Cart State

```js
const cartItems = useSelector((state) => state.cart);
```

#### Example: Routing

```js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
    <Route path="/cart" element={<CartPage />} />
  </Routes>
</Router>
```
